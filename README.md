# FAQ

### • My avatars don't appear in the Figura list, even though they're in the correct folder?
> Check if your avatar has a file called "avatar.json" (don't forget to check file extensions)
> 
> This file can be completely empty, it just needs to be present for Figura to recognise it as an avatar

### • How do I hide the vanilla model?
> At the top of your script, put:
>
> • To hide literally everything (player, armor, elytra, held items):
> ```lua
> vanilla_model.ALL:setVisible(false)
> ```
>
> • To hide only the player:
> ```lua
> vanilla_model.PLAYER:setVisible(false)
> ```
>
> • To hide only armor:
> ```lua
> vanilla_model.ARMOR:setVisible(false)
> ```
> 
> • To hide other, or specific parts, you can check the in-game docs

### • How do I play a Blockbench Animation?
> Simply put this code in your script:
> ```lua
> animations.modelName.animationName:play()
> ```
> Where:
> 
> "`animations`" is the global table which contains all animations
> 
> "`modelName`" is the name of the model you are accessing the animation from
> 
> "`animationName`" is, as the name says, the animation name

### • What are Pings and how do I use them?
> Pings are Lua functions that are executed for everyone running your avatar's script
> 
> Pings are sent from the host player, and can be used to sync things like keypresses or action wheel actions
> 
> To create a ping:
> ```lua
> function pings.myPing(arg1, arg2)
>   -- code to run once the ping is called
> end
> ```
> And to execute the ping, it's as shrimple as calling a lua function:
> ```lua
> pings.myPing("Hello", "World")
> ```
> Note that pings are limited in their content and size, and are rate-limited

### • How can I add an emissive texture?
> Name the texture the same as the non-emissive counterpart, then add `_e` to the end
> 
> And don't forget to set the places you don't want to glow to **transparent black** (#00000000), to also ensure compatibility with shader mods

### • My emissives doesn't glow, nor have bloom with Iris/Optifine shaders?
> Since some shaders doesnt support emissives, a compatibility setting (default on) will change the render type of emissive textures to render them at it were fullbright, however that can lead to some unintended results
>
> You can force your avatar to use the correct emissive render type by using the render type `EYES` on your model

### • How can I use Figura with OptiFine?
> Figura works with Optifine however we still reccomend you try using Sodium/Iris or Rubidium/Oculus instead.
> 
> Check out the full list of [alternatives](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/) instead

### • Where can I find Avatars to download?
> For now you can find Avatars in the showcase channel in the official Discord server (A Web Based and In-Game browser is in the works!)

### • My Minecraft is cracked (non-premium/non-original) or I'm trying to join a cracked offline mode server, why can't I use Figura?
> Figura uses your account's UUID and your Mojang authentication as a way to prove you own that account, avoiding unwanted / malicious uploads
> 
> Non-premium Minecraft accounts don't authenticate with Mojang, and Offline mode servers don't report working UUID's, as such can neither upload nor download Figura avatars
